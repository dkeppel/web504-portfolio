Absolute units:

px is pixel = 1/96 of 1 inch

pt is point = 1/72 of 1 inch

pc is pica = 12pt = 1pc

mm is millimeter = 10mm is 1cm

cm is centimeter = 1cm is 10mm

in is inch = 2.54cm to an inch

Pixels are bad for usability:
- They dont scale
- They dont help other elements to scale proportionally.
- Good for absolute values, i.e. a boarder.

Relative Units

% is percentage = Relative to the parent element'ss value for that property.

em is Em = Relative to the current font-size of the element.

rem is Root em = Relative to the font-size of the root.

ch is character = Relative to width of the "0".

vw is viewport width = Relative to the width of the viewport. 1vw = 1/100th of the viewports width.

vh is Viewport height = Relative to the height of the viewport. 1vw = 1/100th of the viewports height.

vmin is Smaller dimension = 1vmin = 1/100th of vthe viewports smaller dimension

vmac is larger dimension = 1vmin = 1/100th of vthe viewports larger dimension

ex is x-height
